		<i>BOINC</i><i class="right">October 2017</i><br><br>
Small decisions can have big impacts if everyone makes the same small decision. Organ donation falls in that category. As does donating to Wikipedia. I discovered something really cool that neither organs or money but could save lots of both. Itâ€™s called BOINC.<br><br>

BOINC is an app you can download on your computer or Android phone. Anytime your phone is on Wi-Fi, plugged in and unused, it will harness that unused computing power in your phone to perform scientific research. You even get to choose what is researched. Options include disease research, space, mathematics, physics or various other areas of science. Once you set it up it just runs anytime all the conditions of use are met (screen off, Wi-Fi on, plugged in).<br><br> 

It takes a few minutes to set up, from searching it in the Play Store or on Google to actually getting it up and running. If even a small percentage of Android and PC users downloaded it, it would form the most powerful supercomputer in the world by a large margin. And that would probably lead to some very important solutions to very hard problems. Download it.<br><br>
