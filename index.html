    <p>Round One: Being Creative vs. Making Money
There are a number of ways to look at the value of something. Two. 
Monetary value = $$$
Non-monetary value = Not $$$
Everyday, when you’re making big decisions about your life, you have to decide how much value you’re going to create for the world and how much you’ll capture. I made this post to explain my rule for making big decisions and how you can build your own rule for optimal happiness.
Creating value:
Creating value involves the creation of something, whether it’s worth money or not. Musicians create value by creating a series of notes that sound appealing when strung together. A person who revives you using CPR when you’re drowning at the beach creates value by reviving your. Your mom creates value when she says you look sharp/gorgeous in that outfit. All important but none guarantee any money in return, so creation does not guarantee you get to ‘capture’ the value you created
Capturing value:
Capturing value typically results from trade. Stock traders capture value when their investments go up and their able to sell for higher than they bought something for. Employees capture value when a company pays them for their work. Businesses capture value when their customers give them money in return for products and they make a profit. Boring sounding and critically important because without it, there would be no economy or trade.
Your Career
Every career, business and interaction involves a certain amount of creating value, and a certain amount of capturing it. Careers in financial services are heavily skewed to monetary value, making money, and less so toward being creative (depending on who you ask). Careers in arts often skew the opposite way, towards non-monetary intrinsic or emotional, and focus less on making money (unless you’re Banksy or Justin Bieber).
Where to go from here…
The ideal life is one where the amount of money you make satisfies your needs and you are creating as much value for the world as you are capable of. A lot of people end up too far to one side, either making tons of money and really unfulfilled, or having a great time and broke with no upside in sight.
My recommendation is that everyone has to, absolutely must, figure out what the right balance for you is of creating value to capturing it, so that you’re able to make enough money to finance your lifestyle while being fulfilled and enjoying your life. Money is important to survive but you’d be surprised how little an affect it has on happiness relative to being social, something people often sacrifice for money…
“If you volunteer at least once a week, the increase to your happiness is like moving from a yearly income of $20,000 to $75,000. If you have a friend that you see on most days, it’s like earning $100,000 more each year. Simply seeing your neighbors on a regular basis gets you $60,000 a year more.” Source
My Rule
Everyone from economists to start-ups study capturing and creating value but I think the concept goes way beyond economics and money and is reflected in every decision anyone makes in their life and how happy you’ll end up being with it.
I made a rule for myself earlier in my adulthood that I have since applied when I’m making a big ‘being creative vs. making money’ decision… I hope it helps you in finding out what’s important to you.
“I want to create more than I consume, for myself (increase my happiness and net worth) and for the people around me (better relationships, more learning and more profit) to the full extent of my ability, without sacrificing so much that I’m unable to sustain my efforts or enjoy my life”
