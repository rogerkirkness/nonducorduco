		<i>Introduction:</i><br>
		Hi. My name is Roger Kirkness. I live in Waterloo with my fianc√© Jess.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Personal Contact:</i><br>
		My email is: <a href="mailto:me@rogerkirkness.com?Subject=Hello">me@rogerkirkness.com</a><br>
		<br>
		<i>Work:</i><br>
		I work at Shopify developing new markets. My current focus is wholesale.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Education History:</i><br>
		I was unschooled until I was twelve by my parents.
		I went to school at twelve and stayed until I completed high school at sixteen.
		I decided at sixteen I wanted to start and run companies as a way of life so I asked to work at GNC to learn about business.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Work History:</i><br>
		I started at GNC as an unpaid intern helping with marketing. I got promoted a few times and ended up starting and briefly running the Canadian ecommerce division.
		I left GNC to join the family business, Minotaur Software. I spent three years learning about all aspects of the company, and I primarily did sales day to day.<br><br>
		After that time I stopped taking a salary and started a software company called Catchmate that operated in a similar space but offered a more modern version to a new segment of the market. 
		It went okay and I merged it back into Minotaur when I had some customers.<br><br>
		Around the time that I merged Catchmate back into Minotaur I got an offer to join Shopify and do what I had done at GNC and Minotaur: create new markets.
		I am currently working at Shopify developing new markets for various software products. I am also researching ideas in my other areas of interest.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Interests</i>
		<br>
		My main interests are people systems, technological progress, macroeconomics, neuroscience, psychoneuroimmunology and business.
		I read almost entirely nonfiction books, mostly about one of the things above and the people who contribute to them.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Writing</i><br>
		I have written some things on <a href="http://www.rogerkirkness.com/halophytes.html">halophytes</a> and <a href="http://www.rogerkirkness.com/autoimmunity.html">autoimmunity</a>.
