title: Futureschooling

I’d like to propose a variant of homeschooling called futureschooling, which aims to develop children with high and accurate aspirations for themselves. This involves developing a sense of self and maximizing yourself against what you value. The goal is to become great at whatever you choose to pursue.  

These principles, based on the three goods of accelerating technological progress, reducing violence, and increasing personal freedom, can be applied in a homeschooling setting or elsewhere. As I reflect on my experience as an unschooled child (more [here](https://rogerkirkness.com/unschooling)) and my personal philosophies, I plan to use futureschooling to guide my own children's development and continue to evolve my own philosophies.

### Principle #1: Determined Optimism
The future will be better only if we create a better future. Peter Thiel outlined a 2x2 matrix in Zero to One outlining whether a culture is pessimistic or optimistic on one axis, and whether they are determinate or indeterminate on the other. Futureschooling takes for granted that one is a determinate optimist, meaning you believe the future will be better as a result of specific actions. Optimism is good and a widely cultivated value in the West, but we have to be specific about how to make a better future for it to work. 

### Principle #2: Adaption Is The Holiest Trait
A core failing of modern child development is that children are optimized for the local maximum environment of school. When adulthood turns out not to be like school, people would often rather project the school-like environment onto reality than accept reality is not like school was and adapt to it. Whatever the real world throws at you, you want to have a highly effective, minimally costly response for. Adaption is the holiest trait in futureschooling because it prepares you to thrive as change in the world accelerates.

### Principle #3: Character Is Built, Not Found
Many people lack character, including many leaders. Character is the mental and moral qualities that distinguish you from others. Cultivating a sense of self requires effort, risk and struggle. It will not come from ‘looking inward’ in the form of modern mindfulness, which while a useful tool limits you to what you were born with. And it will not come from ‘looking upward’ in the form of historical religions, as they are incompatible with the other principles discussed here. Only through active effort can one build character. 

### Principle #4: Think In Systems
The most economically important forms of work in the future, like software and data, require systems thinking. Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. In order to realize your potential, it’s important to understand the effects of the complex systems that govern modern life. The more you can make yourself independent of the systems that hinder you, and leverage them for gain, the better. 

### Principle #5: Think Divergently
Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. When people make decisions, they often consider an artificially constrained set of alternatives. The best decisions require combining factors from multiple alternative paths, as the best path forward is rarely obvious when making hard decisions. Being able to generate many possible ways of circumventing problems and then rapidly discern the most appropriate combination of factors is critical. 

### Principle #6: Partner With Machines
Generative AI is coming for mediocre knowledge work. Only originating new things will hold water as an economic exercise. This will unlock the creative potential of the world as access to generative AI technologies becomes widespread. It is better to learn how to leverage AI to further your aims than it is to be displaced by it. Creativity in the future will look unrecognizable to the analog creativity we have today. Whatever field you choose to pursue, it is highly likely that you will need to partner with AI to be effective.

### Principle #7: Converge on Utility
Contribute by solving different problems than others. Alpha comes from problem re-definition vs. working on different solutions to the same problems. Do not toil in obscurity without delivering a value product at the end of it for another human being. Don’t compromise yourself or lose your soul, but be useful. Focus on making whatever creative work you offer the world as useful as it can be as the convergent purpose. 

### Principle #8: Specialize Broadly
Operating as an agent in our complex future will require specialization. But single domain specialization is fragile. Specializing in multiple fields, and then skillfully combining those abilities across domains, is the more likely path to thriving. Learning how to pick up new specializations at a deep level in childhood, early adulthood and ongoing is essential to sustained impact. And learning which specializations require which levels of depth of knowledge, understanding and synthesis becomes the core form of learning wisdom. 

### Principle #9: Focus Intensely
People often fail due to a lack of focus or a lack of intensity rather than a lack of resources or opportunity. None of the above points will matter if you engage with your work and learning passively. In a world where social media has captivated the excess attention of extroverts and video games of introverts, being able to focus on things for hours, days, months, years or decades is a crucial skill to cultivate. And then being able to work on those things with uncommon intensity and diligence will make the necessary difference. 

Futureschooling is completely different both from existing definitions of homeschooling and existing approaches to schooling. But it is the set of principles and practices that I believe will be needed to thrive in the future, and make that future good for ourselves primarily and for others in the process.
