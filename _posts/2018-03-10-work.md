I started my career at GNC working in marketing. After a few years of learning, promotions and interesting projects, I left to join the family business <a href="https://www.minotaursoftware.com">Minotaur Software</a>. I spent three years working there learning about all aspects of business, mainly sales. I tried starting a company called <a href="http://catchmate.ca">Catchmate</a> but ended up winding it down when I ran out of cash. Around that time I was recruited by <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a> to help them figure out B2B. Once those efforts matured somewhat I left with a friend to start a company called <a href="https://www.convictional.com">Convictional</a>. I program, do support and occasionally sales.
