The percentage of essays I write that I end up publishing has gone down over time. I have been trying to figure out why that is. Is it because my bar for publishing them is going up? I don’t think that’s the case, if anything I spend less time on each one as I get faster at typing and spend more up front time thinking and reading about something before I write about it. 

I think it might be because I have become more divergent in my thinking from conventional or acceptable ways of thinking. Divergent thinking seems to compound rather than remain a constant, and I think there are essays that I could share which would materially harm my career or family (while often being some of the truest of reality). 

I wonder how many years it will take until the fear of publishing them is overcome by the fear of not publishing them. Remains to be seen.

Edit: I wrote this and then realized life is short and no one cares (so far) what I write online. Posted everything.
