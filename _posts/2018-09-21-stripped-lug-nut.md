title: Stripped Lug Nut
date: September 2018
---
I got a flat tire last weekend -- a big nail was sticking out the side. When I went to change it, I stripped and rounded one of the nuts. This makes it impossible to take the tire off, or change it. To save someone in internet land the pain of figuring this out themselves, the solution is to go to an auto store and get a reverse threaded socket head, put it on a socket wrench and yank. The threads basically eat into the lug, so youâ€™ll need a new one, but it came off easily without breaking anything, which I consider a win. There are also [many YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=reverse+thread+lug+nut+remover+), named things very specific to auto mechanics. But if you can source the part I just described, it should work well.
