Historically, the Western world has been known for individuality. By contrast, much of the developing world embraces more collective cultures. Both tend to have aspects of individuality and collectivism built into identify formation, but the ideal that is pursued tends to be on opposite ends of the spectrum depending on where you are. I think part of what is frustrating people in the Western world about immigration is the shift from individuality to collectivism.

In the past, many immigrants to America wanted to pursue their own individual dream. So people who valued individualism tended to self select and move to America. Over time, the culture in America has shifted along with those of the people in the direction of collectivism. This is partly because the source of much of the immigration happening is countries where collectivism is deeply engrained, which means the center of gravity moves with it.
